The project delves into the exciting field of image classification using deep learning techniques in image recognition. The dataset is made up of professionally shot high-resolution fashion product images that have been cataloged with descriptive categories on their product characteristics.

The objective of the project is to build a Convolutional Neural Network model to classify fashion product images using TensorFow and Keras functional API. The model will then predict the class of a given input image.

The dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset

Different optimization techniques will be used in Python to yield a classification system that is robust enough to address the needs of businesses requiring a product catalog to classify items in an efficient and automated manner.

Examples of industry applications include:

Ecommerce
The fashion industry
Retail
Import/export of products
Marketing
